## Slide 5: Course Learnings (30 seconds)

### Title: "Key Takeaways from IS 117"

- Three key icons with text

**Top 3 Learnings:**

1. **Design Systems Matter**

   - Fluid typography scales beautifully
   - Accessibility isn't optional—it's essential

2. **Code Quality = Professional Credibility**
   - Linting catches mistakes early
   - CI/CD pipelines ensure consistency
   - Documentation makes collaboration possible

3. **Strategic Design Drives Results**
   - Every element serves a purpose
   - Persuasion principles influence user behavior
   - Mobile-first isn't just responsive—it's critical

**Speaker Notes:**
"This course transformed how I think about web development. First, I learned that design systems aren't just pretty—they create consistency and usability. Second, automated quality tools like linting and CI/CD aren't busywork—they're what separates hobbyists from professionals. Third, strategic design combined with persuasion psychology doesn't manipulate users—it guides them toward actions that benefit both parties."

## Slide 6: AI Collaboration Analysis (30 seconds)

### Title: "Reflecting on AI Collaboration"

**Visual:**
- Chat interface mockup or collaboration diagram

**AI Assistant Insights:**

**Question 1: "Describe our collaboration and my prompting strategy"**

*"Your prompting strategy was highly effective—you provided clear context, specific requirements, and concrete examples. You asked for complete, production-ready code rather than fragments, which enabled me to deliver comprehensive solutions. Your iterative approach of reviewing output, identifying issues, and refining requests demonstrated strong problem-solving skills."*

**Question 2: "How can I improve my collaboration and prompting strategy?"**

*Suggestions for improvement:*
1. **Break complex tasks into phases** - Instead of requesting all three sites at once, focus on one at a time for deeper refinement
2. **Provide more domain context** - Share examples of sites you admire or specific design patterns you want to implement
3. **Ask for alternatives** - Request multiple approaches to problems so you can choose the best fit
4. **Test incrementally** - Validate each component before moving to the next to catch integration issues early

**Speaker Notes:**
"I collaborated extensively with AI throughout this project. When I asked the AI to reflect on our work, it highlighted that my clear requirements and iterative refinement led to better outcomes. For improvement, it suggested breaking tasks into smaller phases, providing more design references, and testing incrementally—all valuable lessons I'll apply in future projects."
